# Building a Student Intervention System

With the advent of the data analytics era, student learning data is becoming increasingly
available through various online education tools such as Edmodo etc. The availability of these
data, when coupled with powerful machine learning techniques, will provide invaluable insights
that were never possible before. The aim of this project is to build a student intervention
system that uses high school student data to make predictions about their likelihood of passing
final exam, so that appropriate early intervention can be made to ensure student success.
